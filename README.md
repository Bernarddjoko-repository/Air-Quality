This project aims to predict air quality levels using machine learning models based on environmental data such as pollutant concentrations (CO, NO₂, O₃), temperature, and humidity. The dataset includes real-time air quality measurements, enabling the prediction of key air quality indicators like AQI (Air Quality Index).

## Project Features:
- Data pre-processing (handling missing data, normalization)
- Feature engineering (e.g., pollutant trends over time)
- Multiple machine learning models implemented:
- Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine
- Model evaluation using accuracy, mean squared error (MSE), and R² score
- Cross-validation and visualization of model performance

## Technologies:
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Machine Learning (Regression, Classification)
- Data Visualization (Confusion matrix, performance plots)
