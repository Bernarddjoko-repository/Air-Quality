# Air-Quality
This project aims to predict air quality levels using machine learning models based on environmental data such as pollutant concentrations (CO, NO₂, O₃), temperature, and humidity. The dataset includes real-time air quality measurements, enabling the prediction of key air quality indicators like AQI (Air Quality Index).
Project Features:
Data pre-processing (handling missing data, normalization)
Feature engineering (e.g., pollutant trends over time)
Multiple machine learning models implemented:
Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine
Model evaluation using accuracy, mean squared error (MSE), and R² score
Cross-validation and visualization of model performance
Technologies:
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
Machine Learning (Regression, Classification)
Data Visualization (Confusion matrix, performance plots)
Usage:
Clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the scripts to explore the impact of various pollutants on air quality predictions.
