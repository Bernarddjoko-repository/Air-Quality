# Air-Quality
This project aims to predict air quality levels using machine learning models based on environmental data such as pollutant concentrations (CO, NO₂, O₃), temperature, and humidity. The dataset includes real-time air quality measurements, enabling the prediction of key air quality indicators like AQI (Air Quality Index).
